# FunFun
There's currently nothing for me to put here, but here is a (very, VERY old) demo of this: [https://ioi-xd.net/pages/funfun/index.html](https://ioi-xd.net/pages/funfun/index.html)

This does require a web server due to some CORS bullshit, I've been using `python3 -m http.server 9000` and then going to `http://localhost:8080`
